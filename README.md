# getBackToLessonBot

This is a project that I've created to stay AFK during online lessons. The bot sends your Discord channel a message if someone says the expected words (for example: "Raise your hands") so you get notified and return to the lesson.

Requirements:
  The lessons should be on Microsoft Teams.

  C++ Build Tools
  Tesseract
